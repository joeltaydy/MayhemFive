                <h2> CLOUDTOPUS 1.0 </h2>
                Cloudtopus was founded as a Final Year Project by a group of SMU School of Information Systems students. Cloudtopus 1.0 was built as an integration of digital monitoring tools into a single platform. 
                Built for the the upcoming Enterprise Solutions Management module launched in 2019, the IT Operations Lab has capabilities of monitoring multiple deployments and sending disruptions.
                With tremendous foresight and ideation, Professor Rafael J. Barros from the School of Information Systems Faculty led the team for a successful launch of Cloudtopus in 2019.
